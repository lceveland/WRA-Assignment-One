# Assignment: One HTML and CSS

For this assignment, you will clone Dr. John Monberg's wra410 repository.

You will update your README.md file so that I can learn about the changes you made.

If I can't find your changes, I can't give you credit for them

Revise the following section in your README.md file with a short description of what you've accomplished.

## Required Changes to WRA 410

1. Make changes to the background color of a page and a div.

  Changed the background color of several CSS elements including body, links(a), #container, #header, #main, #footer, and #student-groups in order to create a more calming image.

2. Use a new font.

  Changed the header font to Palatino to create a more elegant feel for the website and I changed the body font to Verdana to make the sight more readable and easily accessible.

3. Include two images.

  Added a MSU Logo to the homepage under the navigation and an envelope icon to the contact page.

4. Use a table to format the Grading Scale on the Assignments page.

  I have turned the grading scale into a prettier, easy to read table.

5. Reformat the Student Groups. Use a different color for links, add a title for each group, seperate each student. Use multiple columns for the divs.

  I have reformatted the student groups into a table that separates students names and makes the information more accessible.

6. Add navgation to the Schedule webpage.

  I have added navigation to the schedule page.

7. Revise the rows and columns on the Schedule webpage so the information is clearer or prettier.

  I added grid gaps and added left and right padding to create a more visually pleasing schedule page that is much more accessible.

Further Changes:

  I added the group link to the navigation for all pages including assignment one. I also titled the navigation and bolded relevant information.
